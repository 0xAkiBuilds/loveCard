        <p>
            Why would we need a Valentine’s Day<br>
            to remind us of the love we share?<br>
            When every waking moment<br>
            begins and ends with you.
        </p>

        <p>
            My thoughts rise with your name,<br>
            my dreams carry your face.<br>
            In every breath I take, I feel you,<br>
            in every closed eye, I see you.
        </p>

        <p>
            You are the reason behind my laughter,<br>
            and the quiet truth in my tears.<br>
            My days belong to you,<br>
            my nights know only you.
        </p>

        <p>
            When my entire life<br>
            is already a reminder of you,<br>
            why would I need another one?
        </p>

        <p>
            I loved you yesterday,<br>
            I love you today,<br>
            and I will love you tomorrow—<br>
            and all the days that follow. 💫
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top:24px;">
            With Love,<br>
            <strong>Yours,<br>Akhi</strong>
