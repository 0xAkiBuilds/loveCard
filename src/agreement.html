            By continuing further, you acknowledge and agree to the following:
        </p>

        <p>
            1. You willingly choose to love me, not just today, but for all the tomorrows that come after.
        </p>

        <p>
            2. You agree to care for me, including on days when I am quiet, distracted, or lost in my own thoughts.
        </p>

        <p>
            3. You accept responsibility for reminding me that I am loved, especially when I pretend I don’t need to hear it.
        </p>

        <p>
            4. You agree to stand by me through good days, bad days, and days that are just “meh”.
        </p>

        <p>
            5. You consent to patience, reassurance, and understanding, even when I make things more complicated than they need to be.
        </p>

        <p>
            6. You acknowledge that loving me is a long-term arrangement with no trial period and no easy exit.
        </p>

        <p>
            7. You agree that our conversations, memories, and shared moments are private, protected, and handled with care.
        </p>

        <p>
            8. You accept that love with me may not always be loud or dramatic, but it will always be real.
        </p>

        <p>
            9. You will love me even at the times that I overthink, feel deeply, and go quiet.
        </p>
